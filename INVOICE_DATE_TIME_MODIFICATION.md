# Invoice Date and Time Modification Feature

## Overview

Administrators can now modify the date and time of invoices in the GT Automotives web application. This feature allows for correcting invoice timestamps when needed.

## Features Added

### 1. Date and Time Editing in Edit Sale Form

- **Location**: `admin/edit_sale.php`
- **New Fields**:
  - Invoice Date (date picker)
  - Invoice Time (time picker)
- **Validation**: Both fields are required and validated for proper format
- **Styling**: Professional styling with visual grouping and helpful notes

### 2. Enhanced Sales Table Display

- **Location**: `admin/sales.php`
- **Improvements**:
  - Shows both date and time in the Date column
  - Visual indicator (üìù badge) when a sale has been modified
  - Hover tooltip shows when the sale was last modified

### 3. Updated Invoice Generation

- **Location**: `admin/generate_invoice.php`
- **Features**: Already displays both date and time separately on generated invoices

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes

- No schema changes required
- Uses existing `created_at` field in the `sales` table
- `updated_at` field tracks when modifications were made

### Form Validation

- Date format validation (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Time format validation (HH:MM)
- Required field validation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Security Considerations

- Only authenticated administrators can modify invoice dates
- All changes are logged via the `updated_at` timestamp
- Input validation prevents malicious data

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

1. **Access Edit Form**:

   - Go to Sales Management (`admin/sales.php`)
   - Click "Edit" button for any invoice
   - Or navigate directly to `admin/edit_sale.php?id=[SALE_ID]`

2. **Modify Date/Time**:

   - Locate the "Invoice Date & Time" section
   - Use the date picker to select a new date
   - Use the time picker to select a new time
   - Both fields are required

3. **Save Changes**:
   - Click "Update Sale" button
   - Changes will be applied immediately
   - A success message will confirm the update

### Visual Indicators

- **Modified Invoices**: Show a üìù badge next to the date in the sales table
- **Hover Information**: Hover over the badge to see when the sale was last modified
- **Invoice Generation**: Generated PDFs will show the updated date and time

## Benefits

1. **Error Correction**: Fix incorrect timestamps from data entry errors
2. **Backdating**: Handle invoices that should have been created on different dates
3. **Audit Trail**: Clear indication when invoices have been modified
4. **Professional Appearance**: Maintain consistent invoice presentation
