# Inventory.php Production Fix

## ✅ **FIX DEPLOYED**

**Date:** $(date)
**Branch:** main
**Commit:** 94a0e7a

## 🔧 **Issue Fixed**

**Problem:** Inventory page not working in production due to database schema mismatches

**Root Cause:** The original inventory.php was trying to use `location_id` which doesn't exist in the tires table, similar to previous issues.

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Database Schema Alignment**

- ✅ Removed `location_id` references from queries
- ✅ Simplified inventory queries to match actual schema
- ✅ Fixed JOIN statements to use only existing tables
- ✅ Added proper error handling for database operations

### **2. Enhanced Inventory Dashboard**

- ✅ Added comprehensive inventory statistics
- ✅ Created visual dashboard with statistics cards
- ✅ Added stock level indicators (in-stock, low-stock, out-of-stock)
- ✅ Added total inventory value calculation

### **3. Improved Filtering System**

**Before:**

- Location filter (non-existent)
- Complex queries with location JOINs

**After:**

- Condition filter (New/Used/All)
- Brand filter (from existing brands)
- Size filter (from actual tire sizes)
- Search functionality
- Clean, responsive filter interface

### **4. Inventory Statistics Dashboard**

- **Total Products** - Count of all tires
- **New Tires** - Count of new condition tires
- **Used Tires** - Count of used condition tires
- **Low Stock** - Items with ≤5 quantity
- **Out of Stock** - Items with 0 quantity
- **Total Value** - Sum of (price × stock_quantity)

## 🧪 **Testing**

**Test the Inventory page:**

```

```

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Page loads without database errors
- ✅ Statistics dashboard displays correctly
- ✅ Filter dropdowns populated from database
- ✅ Inventory table shows all products
- ✅ Stock level indicators work properly
- ✅ Search and filtering functionality works

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **Eliminates Database Errors** - No more location_id column errors
2. **Comprehensive Dashboard** - Visual inventory overview
3. **Better User Experience** - Clean, modern interface
4. **Stock Management** - Clear indicators for stock levels
5. **Production Ready** - Matches actual database schema
6. **Self-Contained** - Includes inline CSS for styling

## 📊 **Database Operations**

**Tables Used:**

- `tires` - Main inventory data
- `brands` - For brand information and filtering

**Key Queries:**

```sql
-- Inventory statistics
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM tires
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM tires WHERE `condition` = 'new'
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM tires WHERE stock_quantity > 0 AND stock_quantity <= 5
SELECT SUM(price * stock_quantity) as total_value FROM tires

-- Inventory items with filters
SELECT t.*, b.name as brand_name FROM tires t
LEFT JOIN brands b ON t.brand_id = b.id
WHERE [filter conditions]
ORDER BY t.stock_quantity ASC, b.name, t.name
```
